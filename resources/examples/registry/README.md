A `Registry` keeps track of many `LegalEvents`. A `LegalEvent` impacts one or multiple `Properties` of a `Record`. `LegalEvents` are either `LegalRequests` or `LegalOutcomes`. A `LegalEvent` may be associated with one or multiple `LegalResources`, which may serve as evidence. 

A `Value` associated with a `Property` and `Record` is effective as of a point in time, and may also no longer be effective as of a given point in time. In the example, we also provide `created` and `lastModified` timestamps but for now these data points are kept outside the data model.
