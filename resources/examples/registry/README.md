A `Registry` has many `Transactions`. A `Transaction` is a legal event which impacts one or multiple `Properties` of a `Record`. `Transaction` is the level where business metadata should be added (who?, why?, when?,...).

A Transaction encapsulates one or multiple `Statements`, with each Statement asserting a discrete fact concerning a `Record`. The `Statement` takes the form of a entity-attribute-value triplet. A `Statement` may hold on or multiple `Values` and is always confined to a single `Property`.

The registry operates on an append-only basis. Updates to property values are executed through a two-step process: initially, the existing value is marked as obsolete by denoting its retirement; subsequently, the new value is appended. A retraction operation follows the same process, but a new value is not provided. This methodology ensures that all historical values are preserved.
