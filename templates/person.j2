{% block summary %}
<p>The ICEG Person application profile aims at facilitating the exchange and exposure of person data in a standardized format.</p>
<p>The profile contains terms that are related to the identification of a person (name, gender, birth day, ...) but also terms that describe the legal characteristics of natural persons (personal relations such as marriage, family and relations with the state such as state citizenship and residency/domicile).</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block conformance %}
<p>An application profile is a specification for the exchange of information that introduces additional limitations for the application of vocabularies. Such additional limitations can contain the following elements:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>refinement of the terminology (classes and properties) consistent with the semantics from the concerning specifications with a specific use as aim;</li>
<li>external terminology (classes and properties) used for new/extra terms that do not apprear in existing vocabularies.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In order to be in accordance with this applicationprofile, the implementation:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>MUST always contain the properties that have cardinality 1 for every class.</li>
<li>CAN NOT contain more than 1 instance of properties that have 1 as maximum cardinality.</li>
<li>CAN use terminology (classes and properties) in a way that is consistent with the semantics (definition, use, domain, range).</li>
<li>CAN NOT use terminology of other controlled vocabulary than the one which is defined in this applicationprofile.</li>
<li>CAN be expanded with classes and properties of other data models (vocabulary) that do not overlap with the terminilogy from this applicationprofile.</li>
</ul>
